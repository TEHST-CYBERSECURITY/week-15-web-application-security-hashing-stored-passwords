# Intro to Authentication Based Web Application Attacks

According to the OWASP Top-10 list of Web Application Vulnerabilitites, *Broken Access Controls* were the most common vulnerability found in 94% of applications, followed by *Encryption Failure* and *Injection* vulnerabilities. Given this fact, as developers and users of software that holds Personally Identifiable Information (PII), our first concern should be the integrity of our authentication systems. 

For this project I've cloned a repository for you that implements a simple website with authentication. You will 1. run and inspect the code, then 2. create a new branch and update the code to fix a few common authentication issues.  Finally, you will merge your branch back into the main one.

# ðŸ¤“ SWBAT 

- Students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of authentication logic by upgrading a simple web application to fix common vulnerabilities associated with authentication systems.
- Students will be able to demonstrate and understanding of Github fundamentals by creating a new feature branch, making code changes, and merging that new branch into the main branch.

# ðŸ‘· Project Requirements 
### ðŸ¦¿ Part 1. Setting up and running your project 
1. Open this repo in a new **codespace** by clicking on the green `< > Code` button (above) then selecting the **Codespaces** tab and clicking on **Create codespace on main**. This will start your codespace.
2. Inside your codespace, open your **Terminal** in your codespace by clicking on the **hamburger icon** at the top-left, then clicking on **View** then **Terminal**. **Note:** Your terminal may already be open by default.
3. Your **Explorer** (on the left side of your codespace) lists all of your project files and directories. You can also type `ls -al` into your terminal to see your file structure at any time. In your Explorer, **right-click** README.md and click **Open Preview**. That will open these directions in your codespace so you can continue in the same window.
4. In your **Terminal**, run your project code by typing the following command: `npm start` into your terminal. The `start` script is defined in line 7 of your **package.json** file and runs the command 'node ./index.js' for you. This will begin the execution of your program.
5. In your **Terminal**, inspect the output of the program and make sure you see the text '**Server listening on Port 3000**' as the last line of output.
6. If your project ran successfully, you should also **see a popup** in the bottom-right of your terminal with the options *Make Public* and *Open in Browser*. **Click** the **Make Public** button then **click** the **Ports (1)** tab next to *Terminal*, **right-click** the url listed under *Forwarded Addresses* and click **Copy Local Address**
7. **Paste** the address that you just copied ***into a different window*** and you should see a website with the title "Welcome to Cybersecurity..." and a form to login. If you do not see the website at this point **please ask for help as you will not be able to continue**.

### ðŸ”® Part 2. Getting to know your project (Future Quiz) 
1. **Nodejs** is a, cross-platform, **runtime environment for executing JavaScript code** that enables developers to build scalable, fast, and efficient applications that can run **on any device**. For example, you could write a program in JavaScript that:
    - runs as a **background process** (script or utility) that doesn't require user input.
    - runs **in your terminal** and accepts user input through the command prompt.
    - runs as a **desktop application** with a fully functional GUI.
    - runs as an **API server** accepting network requests and returning data.
    - runs as a **web server** accepting network requests and returning web pages.
    - runs natively on mobile as an app device 
```
Start-ups and large companies (ie., PayPal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart) alike build software with Node bcs:
    - it allows them to build twice as fast with fewer developers.
    - results, on average, in 33% fewer lines of code and 40% fewer files.
    - handles 100% more requests per second compared to other platforms like Java.
    - decreases the average response time for requests by 35% compared to other platforms.
```
2. **NPM**, or Node Package Manager, is a **command-line utility** that comes pre-installed with Nodejs, and **used to manage and execute** your node projects. NPM is **also a Registry** of open-source projects that you are **free to use in your own projects**. There are over 1.3 projects on NPM that can be used in your project **with a single command** `npm install <package-name>`. But **be careful** because anyone can post their projects on NPM without validation and it is **often a source of vulnerabilities**. Check out https://www.npmjs.com/package/express to explore a popular package called **Express** that we depend on in this project **to implement our HTTP server**.
3. **Explorer** or File Explorer lets you **visualize and navigate your project** file structure easily. Below is a description of each folder and file. **Note:** organization of the folder structure in this project is **arbitrary** and solely for your ease of readability. This project **works the same** if all the files were in the root folder (or **any folder** for that matter.) However, for **other platforms** (ie., Nextjs) **the folder structure matters** and requires that files go in their appropriate folders.
```
server/
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.js     // createUser, login, and logout helper functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ setup.js   // code to setup and configure our server
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ haxxor-matrix.gif   // lol

â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       // your projects definition file

```

### ðŸ¦Ÿ Part 3. Bug Fixes
1. If the project ran successfully, create a new branch where you can make changes, by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
git checkout -b "new-feature"
```
The `-b` flag tells git to create a new branch if the branch doesn't already exist

7. Notice that in the terminal your current branch changed from **(main)** to **(new-feature)** 
8. Write as much code as needed to `index.js` to display the winning team at the end of the output. **HINT:** Create variables to track the team names and final scores, then log it to the console at the end of the program.
9. **Commit** your code to the current branch (`new-feature`) by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
git commit -a -m "added victory message"
```
10. Switch back to the `main` branch by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
git checkout "main"
```
11. Notice that in the terminal your current branch changed from **(new-feature)** to **(main)** and the code you added has disappeared (?)
12. Switch back to the `new-feature` branch by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
git checkout "new-feature"
```
13. Notice that in the terminal your current branch changed from **(main)** to **(new-feature)** and the code that you wrote is back. Your changes live on this branch. You can switch to any other branch and your code will still be on this branch when you come back. When you are done testing and working on this branch you will then merge it with the default branch which, in most cases, is called `main` but you can name it whatever you want.
14. Switch back to `main` (step 11) **then** merge the code from `new-feature` into `main` by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
git merge "new-feature"
```
15. Notice that your code now appears in your `main` branch.
16. Backup your CLI history to submit with your assignment by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
history > cli-backup.txt
```
17. Commit your cli history to the `main` branch by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
git commit -a -m "added cli history"
```
18. **Push** your commits from your (remote) codespace to the (origin) main repository in GitHub by typing the following command into your terminal:
```
git push origin main
```
19. Take a screenshot of your codespace and submit to canvas!
